## ðŸŽ‡OmniBTC is an omnichain financial platform for web3.
  Including OmniSwap, OmniBridge and OmniLending.  
   
### OmniSwap.
  Based on LayerZero,an omnichain interoperability protocol,users can swap any token between any chain with one click. By unifying liquidity on each chain, OmniBTC enables users to swap with one-click and enjoy the best liquidity and the lowest slippage. 

### OmniBridge.
  Lock the deposited bitcoins into the Lightning Network contract, realize decentralized trusted custody, and make the mirror assets $XBTC flow to each chain.

### OmniLending.
  Enable users to deposit/borrow assets on chainA/B/C and withdraw/repay assets on chainB/C/D without bridge. 
  E.g. You can deposit $ETH on Ethereum, and borrow $USDC on #Aptos, but repay $USDC on #Sui, withdraw $ETH on Polygon.

## ðŸ’¡What makes OmniBTC unique?
  The first platform, which successfully introduced fully decentralized trusted $BTC into Aptos/Sui.
  Just one click, without switch pages.
  Best liquidity and lowest slippage for swap users and lending users.
  Wholly decentralized trusted $BTC custodian mechanism, provided by Lightning Network.
  Unify the liquidity on every chain, instead of building up pools, and provide more profits for LPs.

## ðŸ› What problem will be solved?
### Swap Users. 
  For higher profitability, users have to click the bridge & swap buttons frequently, and have to bear higher slippage.
  
### Lending Users. 
  For higher capital utilization, users have to frequently bridge/deposit/withdraw assets in different pages or networks.
  
### Low availability of BTC.
  Bitcoin is not programmable and lacks a decentralized trusted environment, so developers cannot create smart contracts for $BTC or improve its utilization. 
  We are convinced that Bitcoin can do more than value storage.
